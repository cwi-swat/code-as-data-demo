# code-as-data-demo

This masterclass in source code analysis and transformation for [CODAM college](http://www.codam.nl) was recorded and published [here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXiuHQPVD2M).

This demo was the first time we demonstrated the Rascal language workbench in action in VScode using the language server protocol. Before our demonstrations would be in Eclipse exclusively.

Although the code in the current project was written specifically to support this demo; it was derived from earlier demonstrations at ASML, Philips, Rockstars IT, TNO-ESI, PLDI, and IPA Autumn Days.
